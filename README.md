# Tokenize BlockSpace - SmartContracts

This is the main repo for the project's smart contracts. The core idea and innovation is based on the SSTORE2 library's READ & WRITE functions. It makes read and write operations at the fraction of the costs (of SLOAD, SSTORE). This way we can store relatively big files (representing anything, legal documents, CVs, pdsfs.) onchain.

What and how it is doing, please see the diagram below.

### SLOAD Cost (data read)

Reading data is a lot cheaper compared to native SLOAD operations (native solidity storage).

After reading 32 bytes `SSTORE2.read` becomes the cheaper option, and `SSTORE2Map.read` becomes cheaper when reading 33 bytes or more.

| Size (bytes) | SLOAD     | SLOAD2 | SLOAD2 - Map | Savings | Savings (map) |
|--------------|-----------|--------|--------------|---------|---------------|
|            0 |     2.679 |  3.102 |        5.258 |   0,86x |         0,51x |
|            2 |     2.852 |  3.108 |        5.261 |   0,92x |         0,54x |
|           32 |     4.914 |  3.108 |        5.264 |   1,58x |         0,93x |
|           33 |     7.067 |  3.114 |        5.267 |   2,27x |         1,34x |
|           64 |     7.067 |  3.114 |        5.270 |   2,27x |         1,34x |
|           96 |     9.220 |  3.120 |        5.276 |   2,96x |         1,75x |
|          128 |    11.373 |  3.126 |        5.282 |   3,64x |         2,15x |

### SSTORE Cost (data writes)

Writing data is also cheaper than native SSTORE operations (native solidity storage), but gains become apparent after higher data sizes.

After writing 32 bytes `SSTORE2.write` becomes the cheaper option, and `SSTORE2Map.write` becomes cheaper only when writing 128 bytes or more.

| Size (bytes) | SSTORE     | SSTORE2   | SSTORE2 - Map | Savings | Savings (map) |
|--------------|------------|-----------|---------------|---------|---------------|
|            0 |      2.660 |    35.323 |        73.565 |   0,08x |         0,04x |
|            2 |     22.607 |    35.819 |        74.061 |   0,63x |         0,31x |
|           32 |     44.810 |    41.891 |        80.218 |   1,07x |         0,56x |
|           33 |     66.980 |    42.187 |        80.514 |   1,59x |         0,83x |
|           64 |     66.980 |    48.459 |        86.870 |   1,38x |         0,77x |
|           96 |     89.150 |    55.027 |        93.523 |   1,62x |         0,95x |
|          128 |    111.320 |    61.595 |       100.175 |   1,81x |         1,11x |
|          256 |    200.000 |    87.869 |       126.786 |   2,28x |         1,58x |
|          512 |    377.360 |   140.417 |       180.010 |   2,69x |         2,10x |
|         1024 |    732.080 |   245.522 |       286.475 |   2,98x |         2,56x |
|        24576 | 13.878.890 | 4.148.020 |     4.244.998 |   3,35x |         3,27x |


> **Notice:** gas savings may change in future Ethereum hard-forks.

> **Notice x2:** due to contract code limits 24576 bytes is the maximum amount of data that can be written in a single pointer / key. Attempting to write more will result in failure this is why the idea of writing large amount of data in chunks.

## Using this repo

0. Prerequisite: create a .env file with
1. Clone this repository then install dependencies.
`npm ci`
2. Build contracts and generate typechain typeings.
`npx hardhat compile`
3. Run deployment script which will puts the deployments and the 2 files (1 image, 1 pdf) onto the mumbai network. (You can try matic as well).
`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai`

### .env FIle

You will need to create an .env file in the root directory. It needs to contain the following variables:

- MY_PRIV_KEYS [my wallets priv key]
- MUMBAI_PROVIDER [moralis](https://moralis.io/) | [infura](https://infura.io/) | [alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- MATIC_PROVIDER [moralis](https://moralis.io/) | [infura](https://infura.io/) | [alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
